    "# ChessFormer: Teaching Transformers to Play Chess\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook trains a transformer model from scratch to predict chess moves and evaluate positions. Think of it as building a mini chess engine that learns patterns from master games.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's here\n",
    "\n",
    "I've built a complete chess AI using an encoder-only transformer architecture. The model takes a board position (plus some recent history) and predicts what move to play next, along with who's winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The interesting parts:**\n",
    "- **Custom relative attention mechanism** that understands chess geometry (rooks move in lines, bishops on diagonals, etc.)\n",
    "    - we calculate relative position of every data point to every other, similar to how a human might consider the position of each piece relative to the rest of the board\n",
    "- **Position encoding** that captures the last 8 moves plus game state\n",
    "- **Two prediction heads**: one for choosing moves, one for evaluating who's winning\n",
    "- **Interactive play mode** so you can test it yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most chess engines use search trees (like Stockfish), but modern neural approaches like AlphaZero and LC0 showed that deep learning can work incredibly well. This project was directly inspired by LC0's implementation of this exact architecture (in fact I'm using their exact same position representation), because it was able to perform nearly at the level of legit, top engines whilst using significantly less compute. The encoder only stack does not directly compute possible futures, but the hope is that this information is \"implicitly\" considered during the encoding process, as the model deeply considers the current board position and the piece relationships on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's Inside\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup** - Get dependencies and configure the environment  \n",
    "2. **Encoders** - Turn chess boards into tensors the model can understand  \n",
    "3. **Model** - The transformer architecture with chess-specific modifications  \n",
    "4. **Data** - Parse PGN game files and build training examples  \n",
    "5. **Training** - Train the model with proper validation  \n",
    "6. **Inference** - Load the model and predict moves  \n",
    "7. **Play Mode** - Actually play against your trained model!\n",

    "## 1. Setup & Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's get everything installed and configured. The notebook is designed to work anywhere—your laptop, Colab, Kaggle, etc. You can control everything through environment variables without touching the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose an encoder-only architecture for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encoders vs. Decoders**: Chess positions are static—you evaluate the whole board at once, not one square at a time. This is different from language, where you generate word-by-word. An encoder is perfect for this \"understand everything, then decide\" pattern. Also, it allows us to use a more sophisticated position representation method as we just feed the encoder into a linear classifier layer, rather than running a whole decoder which will try and \"finish\" the sequence we feed into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why relative attention matters**: Normal transformers treat positions abstractly. But in chess, *distance* matters. A rook cares about pieces on its rank and file. A knight cares about L-shaped jumps. By adding 2D spatial bias to attention, the model can learn these geometric patterns naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**History encoding**: Chess isn't just about the current position—you need to know if pieces have moved (castling rights), if positions are repeating (threefold repetition), and recent tactical themes. I encode the last 8 half-moves as a 119-channel \"image\" of the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the setup on CPU:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export TINY_RUN=1\n",
    "export FORCE_CPU=1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For real training, point to your PGN file:\n",
    "    - I designed this with the use of the LiChess Elite Dataset in mind, I was only using a single month at a time but if you want to upscale the model you could tweak and use a whole year or even the whole thing\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export PGN_PATH=\"/path/to/your/games.pgn\"\n",

    "## 2. Encoding Chess Positions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's where we convert chess boards into tensors. Think of it as translating the board into a language neural networks understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Encoding Scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent each position as a **119×8×8 tensor**—basically a stack of 119 chess boards, each highlighting different information:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Piece history (112 channels)**:\n",
    "- For the last 8 half-moves, I record where all the pieces were\n",
    "- 6 planes per side (pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens, kings) × 8 timesteps = 96 planes\n",
    "- Plus 16 planes tracking position repetitions (important for detecting draws)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current context (7 channels)**:\n",
    "- Castling rights (can each side still castle?)\n",
    "- Whose turn it is\n",
    "- 50-move rule counter\n",
    "- Move number\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why History Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "This is better than just encoding the current position because chess has a lot of implicit state:\n",
    "- **Castling**: You need to know if the king or rooks have moved\n",
    "- **Repetitions**: Threefold repetition is a draw—the model needs to avoid it\n",
    "- **Tactics**: Recent piece movements often signal tactical themes\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Coordinate System\n",
    "\n",
    "One tricky bit: chess notation goes rank 1 (bottom) to rank 8 (top), but tensors are indexed top-to-bottom. So I flip the ranks:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "token_idx = (7 - rank) * 8 + file\n",
    "```\n",
    "This keeps everything consistent between encoding and the model's attention mechanism."

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Game-Level Splitting Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Early versions of this code split positions randomly, which caused problems; if position 10 from a game is in training and position 11 is in validation, the model can \"cheat\" by memorizing the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now I split at the game level first, then extract positions. This ensures validation truly tests generalization to unseen games.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dataset Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ChessPositionDataset` is self-contained; all encoding functions are embedded as static methods. This solves a tricky issue: PyTorch's multiprocessing DataLoader spawns worker processes, and if they try to reference functions from other cells, you get pickle errors. By making everything self-contained, the dataset \"just works\" with multiple workers."

    "Total Loss = Policy Loss + Value Loss\n",

    "\n",
    "**Policy loss**: Cross-entropy between predicted move probabilities and the actual move. I only look at logits for the source square of the played move—this makes the problem easier than predicting over all 64×action_size possibilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "I'm using AdamW (Adam with weight decay, better than plain Adam for transformers) and tracking the best model by validation loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing I learned: device-safe indexing matters. When you do `policy_logits[batch_idx, source_squares, :]`, those indices need to be on the same device as the tensor. \n",

    "### What to Expect\n",
    "\n",
    "Training loss should drop fairly quickly in the first epoch, then slow down. Value loss typically decreases faster than policy loss—predicting who won is easier than predicting exact moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a tiny run, you'll see high losses (8-10) because the model barely sees any data. A real training run should get below 5.0 after a few epochs."

    "## 7. Inference & Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Inference Works\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: Move history in UCI notation (e.g., [\"e2e4\", \"e7e5\"])\n",
    "   ↓\n",
    "Replay moves on a board\n",
    "   ↓\n",
    "Encode the position history\n",
    "   ↓\n",
    "Forward pass through model\n",
    "   ↓\n",
    "Filter to legal moves only\n",
    "   ↓\n",
    "Return best move + probability + value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Critical Fix\n",
    "\n",
    "Early versions had a bug where training and inference used different coordinate systems. The encoder flips ranks (rank 8 → row 0), but inference was using raw square indices. This meant the model would suggest moves from the wrong squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now both use the same rank-flipped mapping:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "token_idx = (7 - rank) * 8 + file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Suite\n",
    "\n",
    "I've included four tests:\n",
    "1. **Model loading**: Checks the checkpoint loads and config matches\n",
    "2. **Basic inference**: Predicts a move from the starting position\n",
    "3. **Known position**: Tests on Scholar's Mate setup (should find checkmate!)\n",
    "4. **Top-K moves**: Returns multiple candidates with probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "These catch most common issues—coordinate bugs, vocabulary mismatches, device problems, etc."

    "## 📚 Opening Book: Playing Known Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the easiest ways to improve chess engine strength is to use an **opening book**—a database of known good opening moves. Why waste compute predicting e2e4 when we already know it's one of the best first moves?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Opening Books Work\n",
    "\n",
    "The first 5-10 moves of a chess game are well-studied. Grandmasters have spent centuries analyzing openings like the Sicilian Defense, Ruy Lopez, or King's Indian Defense. There's no need for our model to \"figure out\" that e2e4 is good when we can just hard-code it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "- **Saves compute**: No inference needed for early moves\n",
    "- **Stronger play**: Guarantees optimal opening moves\n",
    "- **Faster games**: Instant responses in the opening phase\n",
    "- **Better training signal**: Model focuses on the interesting middlegame/endgame positions\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll build a simple opening book that:\n",
    "1. Stores known opening sequences as a dictionary tree (transposition-aware)\n",
    "2. Checks if the current position is in the book\n",
    "3. If yes, plays the book move; if no, falls back to the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The book will store moves by position (FEN without move counters) rather than move sequence, so we handle transpositions correctly. For example:\n",
    "- `1. e4 e5 2. Nf3` and `1. Nf3 e5 2. e4` reach the same position\n",
    "- Our book will recognize both paths and play the same continuation"

    "## ⚡ Performance Optimizations: Training Faster & Better\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's add three \"quick wins\" that significantly improve training quality and speed:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Learning Rate Scheduling**\n",
    "Instead of using a fixed learning rate throughout training, we'll use **Cosine Annealing**. This gradually reduces the learning rate following a cosine curve, allowing the model to:\n",
    "- Make large updates early (explore the loss landscape)\n",
    "- Make tiny, precise updates later (fine-tune the optimum)\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like searching for treasure: run around quickly at first, then search carefully when you're close.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Gradient Clipping**\n",
    "Sometimes gradients can explode (become huge values), causing training to diverge. **Gradient clipping** caps the gradient norm to prevent this. It's like putting a speed limiter on your car—you can still accelerate, but not so fast that you lose control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Mixed Precision Training (for GPUs with Tensor Cores)**\n",
    "Your RTX 4070 has Tensor Cores that can do math in **FP16 (half precision)** much faster than FP32. Mixed precision:\n",
    "- Uses FP16 for most computations (2-3x faster)\n",
    "- Keeps FP32 for critical operations (maintains accuracy)\n",
    "- Uses automatic loss scaling to prevent underflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected improvements:**\n",
    "- Training speed: ~2-3x faster on RTX 4070\n",
    "- Memory usage: ~30-40% reduction (can use bigger batches!)\n",
    "- Convergence: Better due to learning rate scheduling\n",
    "- Stability: Improved from gradient clipping\n",

    "\n",
    "The optimized training loop adds three key improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Cosine Learning Rate Annealing** - Starts high for fast learning, gradually decreases to fine-tune the optimum. You'll see the LR printed in each epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Gradient Clipping** - Prevents training instability by capping gradient norms at 1.0. This stops the model from making wild updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Mixed Precision (FP16)** - Automatically enabled on CUDA. Runs ~2-3x faster and uses 30-40% less VRAM on your RTX 4070's tensor cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected improvements:**\n",
    "- Training speed: 2-3x faster on GPU with tensor cores\n",
    "- Memory: 30-40% less VRAM (can fit bigger batches!)\n",
    "- Convergence: Smoother due to LR scheduling\n",
    "- Stability: Better from gradient clipping\n",
